Warning
=======

__This is very unfinished work-in-progress code.__ You _will_ encounter glitches, broken functionality, etc., etc. Do not _expect_ anything related to OoT3D/MM3D (models, animation, archives, etc.) to work and be happy if something _does_. There should, however, _not_ be any problems just running the application.

Also note that this repository supersedes [the old source code archive](http://magicstone.de/dzd/random/3ds/N3DSCmbViewer-bin-src.rar) posted last year.

Documentation
=============

A spreadsheet with links to documentation about OoT3D and MM3D, maintained by members of the #zelda IRC channel on BadnikNET, [can be found here](http://tinyurl.com/zelda-resource).
